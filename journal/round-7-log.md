# #100DaysOfCode - Seventh Attempt

Welcome to my seventh attempt at the #100DaysOfCode challenge! This repository will document my journey as I commit to coding for 100 days. Each day, I will update this README with my progress, challenges, and things I learned.

## Challenge Rules

1. I will code for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. I will tweet my progress using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
3. I will update this repository daily with my progress.

## Progress Log

| Day | Date       | Focus                | My Progress               | Challenges                | Lessons Learned               |
|-----|------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1   | 06/06/2024 | Tarot and Astrology Flask App | Got the login page to redirect to settings if the user hasn't set up their initial profile and notification settings. | Struggled for a bit, figuring out how to handle the individual notification settings, if the user has opted not to receive either in app or email notifications. Decided to just check if they have notifications enabled when handling notification creation, and then if they do we'll then check if they want that particular type of notification. That should work. I guess we'll see when we get to handling notifications | Sometimes simpler is better lol |
| 2   | 06/07/2024 | Learning Django! | Well, TERRIBLE progress in record keeping, as it is now 6/8 lol. But. well, terrible progress in Django as well. This is so much more complex than flask. Wtf is an app? Is that like a blueprint? Why don't we put the models all together? Soo many questions! So... back to the progress. I've created a project. I've decided (probably unwisely) to follow a learn django by building a blog tutorial, but instead of building a blog I'm going to create a Content Management app. I got the project set up, my first app added ('posts') and the model created. Then, when I went to run it again, I got a Page Not Found error. So, that was all the progress I made today. Not much. | So many. I' gonna watch some videos on Django and try to get a better grasp of how it works, becase I'm at a loss right now. And I installed django-ckeditor which apparently is no longer supported, so I had to uninstall it and install django-ckeditor-5, and then I couldnt migrate the updated model because the old migration had references to django-ckeditor, which was uninstalled. I got that figured out, but like I said earlier, then I got a page not found error so we're still stuck. I think I'm going to find a different tutorial. The django girls one is good, but I need a video I think. | Well, if I were responsible I'd say I learned that I should follow the tutorial, not try to build an entirely different web app with absolutely no knowledge of the framework I'm working in. But I'm not responsible. I haven't learned shit lol. Well, I learned how to create an app and a model. That's not nothing I guess. |
