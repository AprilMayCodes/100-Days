## Challenge Rules

1. I will code for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. I will tweet my progress using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
3. I will update this repository daily with my progress.

## Progress Log

| Day | Date       | Focus                | My Progress               | Challenges                | Lessons Learned               |
|-----|------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1   | 06/06/2024 | Tarot and Astrology Flask App | Got the login page to redirect to settings if the user hasn't set up their initial profile and notification settings. | Struggled for a bit, figuring out how to handle the individual notification settings, if the user has opted not to receive either in app or email notifications. Decided to just check if they have notifications enabled when handling notification creation, and then if they do we'll then check if they want that particular type of notification. That should work. I guess we'll see when we get to handling notifications | Sometimes simpler is better lol |
| 2   | 06/07/2024 | Learning Django! | Well, TERRIBLE progress in record keeping, as it is now 6/8 lol. But. well, terrible progress in Django as well. This is so much more complex than flask. Wtf is an app? Is that like a blueprint? Why don't we put the models all together? Soo many questions! So... back to the progress. I've created a project. I've decided (probably unwisely) to follow a learn django by building a blog tutorial, but instead of building a blog I'm going to create a Content Management app. I got the project set up, my first app added ('posts') and the model created. Then, when I went to run it again, I got a Page Not Found error. So, that was all the progress I made today. Not much. | So many. I' gonna watch some videos on Django and try to get a better grasp of how it works, becase I'm at a loss right now. And I installed django-ckeditor which apparently is no longer supported, so I had to uninstall it and install django-ckeditor-5, and then I couldnt migrate the updated model because the old migration had references to django-ckeditor, which was uninstalled. I got that figured out, but like I said earlier, then I got a page not found error so we're still stuck. I think I'm going to find a different tutorial. The django girls one is good, but I need a video I think. | Well, if I were responsible I'd say I learned that I should follow the tutorial, not try to build an entirely different web app with absolutely no knowledge of the framework I'm working in. But I'm not responsible. I haven't learned shit lol. Well, I learned how to create an app and a model. That's not nothing I guess. |
| 3   | 06/08/2024 | Learning Django | Figured out why my page wasn't loading.. I'd typed to extend from 'blog/base.html' but there was no blog directory. i'm not making a blog. Silly mistake lol. Watched more videos on Django and I think I have a better grasp of it, but really it's just Flask with a lot of extra steps |  | |
| 4   | 06/09/2024 | Learning Django | Got the log in and out and register functionality added and some basic styles added. It's not great looking, but I'm mainly focusing on functionality, styling comes next. I wish I'd have gotten father but I was having a lot of trouble focusing today. I'm happy with the progress I made though. | Wasn't sure the best way to set up the models so that I can have multiple attachments, that can be any type of file format, and a post can have multiple attachments, and then how to set up the forms that allow for this. Will be focusing on this more tomorrow. | |
| 5   | 06/10/2024 | Flask Project Skelton Creator and Content management app | Today was much more productive than yesterday. Got all the auth routes (login and out, register, password reset, settings, channel setings, etc) taken care of. Just need styling, but the functionality is there. Then I worked on a Flask Project Skeleton Creator, which was a bit tedious to make, but I'm really happy with the result | just some styling bs with the cms. The generator was more frustrating because I had to figure out how to handle the indenting, and how to remove the space from the blueprints so they arent importing with extra whitespace. Should be simple, but I struggled for a bit | .strip() is your friend when handling comma separated lists from user input lol |
| 6   | 06/11/2024 | Learning DearPyGui | Got a basic feel for the structure down. It's very different from like Kivy and Tkinter. Like, much more straightforward. I'm hoping that will make it easier to create a kind of complex app, but we'll see. | Trouble with a circular import with the navigation file had me scratching my head for a bit. Got a workaround by creating a screen_manager to help handle it, but it's a little clunky. Probably not the best way to handle it, but it runs so what are you gonna do | There's always another project! Especially when you're in the middle of three... lol |
| 7   | 06/12/2024 | pyStructify | I'm really feeling comfortable working with dearPyGUI. It's so straightforward and simple (in the best way). Today I set up a few screens and a screen manager for my app. I think it's coming along nicely. | Despite all that good shit I was talking, I did face a lot of issues. Number one, circular imports. Figuring out how to work around that took some time, but I think I've got a decent set up now. Number two, images. I wanted to set a logo as teh background image on the home screen and MAN was that a tale of trial and error lol. I do see some limitations with this GUI. It's actually in a lot of the things I love about it. Kivy and Pygame for example require a lot of legwork. Create the widget, give it a size, give it a position, then display it. With dearPyGui it's add_text("text!) and boom, it's on the screen. This is brilliant! And also a bit frustrating when I can't center or position things easily without knowing the exact pos I want it at. But stylings not my strong suit anyway, so I don't mind too much. | Once you start coding, the ideas really start flowing! I started with a basic flask project generator and have thought of so many additional features I'm so excited to implement! |
| 8   | 06/13/2024 | pyStructify | So much progress! Spent today working on my Preferences screen, added all the default starter code and added functionality that allows the user to update this code if desired. Also checks for a default directory upon opening and if it's not set, you're directed to the Preferences page instead of the home page. Lots of other little things. And then the styling. Went through like 5 different color schemes before I decided on one (more because I was tired of dealing with it than because it spoke to me but oh well). The themes are pretty cool, but I do find myself wishing there were more customizeable options. (Button text color for example, instead of creating a separate button theme and having to apply it to every button. Sigh.) | Not so much a coding thing but dealing with the styling was a bitch and a half. And I'm still not thrilled with it. | I AM NOT AN ARTIST |
| 9   | 06/14/2024 | pyStructify | realized I forgot several options when I created my preferences page. So I updated it to hav a tab for general settings and a tab for flask settings. | no real trouble setting this stuff up, just frustration redoing it all lol | patience is key lol |
| 10  | 06/15/2024 | pyStructify | got all my links reset and updated my restore defaults button to behave differently depending on which defaults were restored (flask or general) | more tedium. had a bit of trouble figuring out how to handle storing the updated starter code so that it could be restored without restoring everything else. But once I got it the rest came easily |  |
| 11  | 06/16/2024 | pyStructify | tested all the restore default buttons and started building the page that shows once you click 'create project' (for flask projects. will be a different page if its not a flask projects. havent decided how i'm gonna do that one yet) | no real challenges today, just lots of repetition | patience, patience, lol |
| 12  | 06/17/2024 | pyStructify | ugh, not much. I've at least got the basic page and tabs added, but getting the project name, that should be stored with the tag "project_name" has proven to be more difficult than it should be. Also, there are three input boxes showing up at the top of my page. Did I put them there? Nope. Where are they coming from?! | I'm doing something wrong, clearly. But what? | |
| 13  | 06/18/2024 | pyStructify | After what feels like several hours staring at the code making no progress, I figured it out! I was setting the value of project_name, but when I hid the new_project window it basically reset that value (so that upon reentering the new project window you arent seeing the last project name you put in). I fixed it by moving the code to reset the project name input to an empty string to the show function for the new_project screen. So when you show it, it resets it to an empty string instead of doing it when you hide it. Oh, and what I thought were input fields up at the top was actually the table header. I forgot to set table_header=False when creating the table | Man I spent so much time stuck on this it almost discouraged me from continuing the project. Which sounds silly now, but it really had me stressin. | Sometimes it really is something simple. Dont give up!|
| 14  | 06/19/2024 | pyStructify | Made a LITTLE bit of progress today, continuing to set up the 'config_flask' page, but then I realized that when I set and save default values, they weren't saving the way I expected them to. Turns out, using source on a widget is a TWO way bind, so updating the widget updates the source value as well. If I had thought about it for any amount of time, this probably would have been obvious. But alas, I am not a thinker apparently. This has set me hours and hours behind, as I have to restrucure my entire preferences page. And I thought I had it working so well. | Basically covered this in the last cell, but yeah. Found a critical bug, will have to spend a lot of time refactoring to get the preferences page to have to expected functionality. | READ the docs, April. Don't just skim them for what looks useful. Understand the code you're implementing! |
| 15  | 06/20/2024 | #100Devs Class 2 | Completed the Class 2 video and basically learned that EVERYTHING I thought I understood about HTML was completely wrong and I've got a lot of bad coding habits to unlearn. I really thought I was gonna be skipping through the HTML sections because I already know how to use HTML, but man. I found out I know how to use HTML the WRONG way. It's embarrassing how confident I was that I wasn't gonna need these beginning courses. I'm so glad I decided to watch the whole video, because I really learned a lot|The homework to recreate the BBC website wasn't really a challenge, but I did have to like, break away from the bad habits I have so that I could incorporate all the information that I learned. |HTML Semantics are important. You can achieve the desired look with <div> and <p> but you'll be doing it wrong.|
| 16  | 06/21/2024 | pyStructify | Restructuring the preferences page didn't take as long as I thought it was going to, got that done and was finally able to move on to the actual project creation and... got that done as well! I'm so proud of myself :D I'm not done by any means, but like. I've got a whole ass app here. It's really coming along, and I think I'm really gonna end up with a finished product here lol| ran into a few more bugs, but that's bound to happen. Just means I've got tomorrows agenda planned out | |
| 17  | 06/22/2024 | pyStructify |worked on some minor bug fixes in the create flask project page. What happens if they don't put in a blueprint name, stuff like that. Also added a loading indicator that pops up when the project is being created, and disappears when the "Your project has been created" window pops up.|                           |                           |
| 18  | 06/23/2024 |pyStructify|restructuring my project to add the DearPyGUI-Markdown module. I think it will be easier to structure text the way I want it this way, rather than a million different themes in each place.|Not really a challenge as much as it is a source of frustration; There is *a lot* of text in my project. I was going to have to address this at some point, but it's gonna take some time to figure out just how I should style it and then to go through and apply that all using the markdown instead of themes. Glad I made this decision early before I got too many more screens created lol|                           |
| 19  | 06/24/2024 |pyStructify| got so much done today! Got started on the general project structure and after much trial and error, finally figured out a way to design it that's simple and convenient for the user to create files and folders and structure them as desired.| Kept thinking Oh, I'll do like a drag and drop interface, then oh i'll have buttons next to the node name, etc, and running into the issue that DearPyGUI just doesn't have really work the way that I'd need it to in order to achieve what I was going for. Currently stuck on how to make both files and directories selectable, so you can edit or delete them if needed, without giving the option to add subdirectories on to files. Will work on it more tomorrow|                           |
| 20  | 06/25/2024 |pyStructify and python basics series| got the ability to edit and delete files and dirs (except the root) and only show the option to add stuff if youve selected a dir not a file. also worked on my tutorial series a bit|                           |                           |
| 21  | 06/26/2024 | pystructify | working on finalizing the create general project page. Got a preview added, but started thinking about ways users could break it; navigating away from teh page mid project creation for example, and started building in workarounds for stuff like that| just tedium. Like, wish i'd considered this earlier so i'd wrote it when i wrote each screen, instead of having to go back to each one and add the functionality |                           |
| 22  | 06/27/2024 | pyStructify |I'm in the endgame now! I've got to go through and add styling, and reformat a lot of my code, add docstrings, etc. But it's nearly done! I also created a docs page for it that's up and running on github pages right now. I'm so psyched! | Struggled for a bit figuring out how to use mkdocs, but once I got it down it was pretty simple. |I'm so freaking excited :D |
| 23  | 06/28/2024 | pyStructify |didn't make much progress on the project today. Spent most of my time researching the proper way to do docstrings. Couldnt really find a consensus|                           |                           |
| 24  | 06/29/2024 |pyStructify|finalized the walkthrough. Had to do it with a button press instead of immediately on start up the first time, but I think thats more user friendly anyway|                           |                           |
| 25  | 06/30/2024 |pystructify|went through every page of my app and made a list of changes (style stuff, typos etc) that need to be made. got started working on that. The home page is officially done!|                           |                           |
| 26  | 07/01/2024 |pyStructify refactoring|working through my list, adding styling and reformatting the code.|                           |                           |
| 27  | 07/02/2024 |pyStructify refactoring|got a couple more pages done, styling stuff added, docstrings and refactoring done etc|no real challenges. Just the realization that I'm not quite as close to having it completed as I initially thought. a bummer, but I'll get there eventually!||
| 28  | 07/03/2024 |                      |                           |                           |                           |

| 48  | 07/23/2024 | Pokemon Text Based Game | used pokeapi to get the data for gen 1 pokemon in a dictionary, including their moves, evolution info, and locations for encounters. Then wrote a script to automate creating a class for all 151 pokemon that inherits from a base pokemon class. |                           | So I've been doing a bad job of recording my progress - BUT I HAVE been coding every day for the last three weeks! I officially completed and deployed by first project - and it's not pyStructify lol. I made a HIPAA compliant records management system for the clinic I work for. Before that, I'd been working on my website. Gonna get back into that soon here. Also made a portfolio, updated my resume, and started putting in applications. :D |
| 49  | 07/24/2024 | Pokemon Text Based Game | Worked on fixing up the Pokemon Class and implementing the formulas used in the gen 1 pokemon games for using moves, calculating stats, gaining xp, etc |                           |                           |
| 50  | 07/25/2024 | Website | Finished the home page! Got some icons I like, and hover styling and all that good stuff. Next up - the admin routes. How I'll manage blog posts, upcoming content, etc. | I was working really hard on doing this project *right* as in like, structure and organization and all that, but still, coming back to it after all the time off while I was working on CHCloud has been a little rough. Just getting a feel for it again lol. I feel like this will be something I chip away at little by little until it's completed. |                           |
| 51  | 07/26/2024 | Pokemon Text Based Game | Starting working on the save/load functionality and adding more story-like elements to the game (more of a text intro, etc). | it's hard to format a save/load feature when the structure of everything that needs to be saved and loaded isn't fleshed out yet. This will probably take a back burner til the project is more developed. |                           |
| 52  | 07/27/2024 | Learning C# | It's sounding like, in order to make software dev a career, I'm going to need to learn some new skills. Specifically C#/.NET so I picked up The C# Players Guide, and have been working my way through the excercises. Breezing through these first levels because it's all coding concepts I know, just with new syntax. (level 4 and counting! :D ) I'm excited to get through the book and start learning more about what all .NET has to offer|                           |                           |
| 53  | 07/28/2024 | Learning C# | Level 5! Officially through The Basics, and on to Part 2 of The C# Players Guide! |                           |                           |
| 54  | 07/29/2024 | learning C# | completed a lot more challenges in C# players guide | It seems like there's a lot more to C# than to python. It's weird to get used to, but I think I'm doing all right|                           |
| 55  | 07/30/2024 | Learning C# | got through the first of the class challenges | overcomplicated the Classes challenge, which is no biggie, except the next 3 challenges were basically updating your solution from the previous one. So I turned what would have been a couple tweaks to a much more complex problem lol. It's hard to stop thinking in python though. I think I'll run into this issue less once I learn more C# though. Like I'll have additional tools once I learn em, so I won't be struggling like "This would be so easy with a freaking dictionary!" lol|                           |
| 56  | 07/31/2024 |Learning C# | made it to level 6! |Not totally sure I understand static, and like information hiding 100% yet, but I'm getting there. |                           |
| 57  | 08/01/2024 | learning C# and potential CRC Card GUI project? | Read and completed the challenges for chapters 22-24. The Object Oriented Design and idea of CRC cards got me thinking, though. I don't love pen and paper planning, I'd much rather use an online tool but couldn't find one that was exactly what I was looking for for CRC cards. I know there's things like lucidchart and miro, but they're kind of feature heavy. Which is great, except that it's way more than the functionality that I need lol. So, I thought why not make my own? Started a project with wxPython, but I'm still learning the framework so it'll be slow going. We'll see where it goes. |                           |                           |
