## Day 2: Monday December 13, 2021
-   **Today’s Progress**: Added the ability to choose an image, and made it work whether or not there was an image included
-   **Thoughts:** Couldn't find how to add media using v2 of the API. I must have been overlooking something but I really struggled with that before I realized I could just switch to v1 which was a lot more clear.

## Day 4: Wednesday December 15, 2021
-   **Today's Progress**: Accidentally deleted all of my projects.. All of them. I don't want to talk about it.
-   **Thoughts:** Well.. time to start rebuilding I guess. Starting organizing my code from replit to put on here.

## Day 7: Saturday December 18, 2021
-   **Today's Progress**: Redid the blackjack game, with the tutorial, and the higher-lower game on my own.
-   **Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with the blackjack one. I think I was trying to do too much within one function, I should have broken it down more. Ended up following the tutorial to finish that one, but I was able to do the other from scratch.

## Day 8: Sunday December 19, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Completed projects 15 and 16 without the tutorial. The Coffee Machine and then the OOP version of the Coffee Machine
-  **Thoughts**: I rushed through these sections before and it led to me struggling a lot with classes and OOP. I'm a lot more comfortable after slowing down and having redone this project. I'm feeling a lot better about using classes now.

## Day 11: Wednesday December 22, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Started rebuilding my tarot-journal. Got the basic flask setup done, then I got sidetracked with astrology stuff. Played around with the flatlib libary and figured out how to create charts and access the data from them
-  **Thoughts**: Spent a lot of time fighting with the library because the pyswisseph wasn't finding a file it needed... I'm thinking the error had something to do with the virtual environment, and I'm fairly sure my bandaid fix won't work as a permanent solution, but for now it's doing what I want it to.

## Day 12: Thursday December 23, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Set up a login and register template and started choosing some colors for them.
-  **Thoughts**: I want to do this without using any templates, which means I'll be spending a long time on these probably. I want it to be responsive and web design in general is just not my strong suit. Got a lot to learn!

## Day 13: Friday December 24, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Got a card centered in the page and added a shadow. It's not much but getting the card the right size and positioned how I wanted took me longer than expected
-  **Thoughts**: It occurrs to me that this would be easier if I'd sketched out what I want it to look like beforehand.

## Day 14: Sunday December 26, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Set up the forms.py file and made the LoginForm and RegisterForm

## Day 15: Monday December 27, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Made the login form template, took me a min to get it formatted how I want. Still haven't decided exactly how I'm going to do the register form, if I want to ask for all the info in it or have just an email and password to register and then an 'update' option where you can add the rest of the details.

## Day 16: Tuesday December 28, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Set up the register form and started playing around with the formatting. Got an API to get the UTC offset based on the coordinates, so I can use that along with the other one to get the coordinates from the location name or zip code. Created get_coordinates and get_offset functions and made sure I understood how the APIs worked.

## Day 17: Wednesday December 29, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Set up the database and finished setting up the login and register pages. Registering will generate and save a birth chart for the user. That info will be used to compare to the daily pages to check for aspects, once I get around to setting that up.

## Day 18: Friday December 31, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Took a day off when I had to go to the hospital for dehydration. Back with a vengeance today! Spent a lot of time messing with the css to make the registtration page responsive. Created more problems than I solved, but also figured out (I think) the way to fix them. There's a few changes I need to make to the registration form anyway, with the DOB and Birth time entry, so it doesn't have to be entered formatted properly, making it a little more user-friendly. Gonna fiddle with it some more tomorrow.
