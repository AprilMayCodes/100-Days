## Day 2: Monday December 13, 2021
-   **Today’s Progress**: Added the ability to choose an image, and made it work whether or not there was an image included
-   **Thoughts:** Couldn't find how to add media using v2 of the API. I must have been overlooking something but I really struggled with that before I realized I could just switch to v1 which was a lot more clear.

## Day 7: Saturday December 18, 2021
-   **Today's Progress**: Redid the blackjack game, with the tutorial, and the higher-lower game on my own.
-   **Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with the blackjack one. I think I was trying to do too much within one function, I should have broken it down more. Ended up following the tutorial to finish that one, but I was able to do the other from scratch.

## Day 8: Sunday December 19, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Completed projects 15 and 16 without the tutorial. The Coffee Machine and then the OOP version of the Coffee Machine
-  **Thoughts**: I rushed through these sections before and it led to me struggling a lot with classes and OOP. I'm a lot more comfortable after slowing down and having redone this project. I'm feeling a lot better about using classes now.
