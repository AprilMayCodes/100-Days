# Round 2 Log

**Start date**: 07/26/21
**End date**: xx/xx/xx

## Goals

-   Spend an hour each day learning to code

## Day 1 - 07/26/21

-   **Project You Are Working On:** Does this repo count? Lol I've edited it quite a bit, added the round 2 page, cleaned the README part up. That's coding, right? No?
-   **Progress Today:** In all seriousness, what I'm working on today is the 'getting started' portion of appacademy.io. I'm recommitting to learning to code, but I haven't decided yet what 'course' I'm going with. I'm really liking the way the appacademy lessons are set up, so I'll probably just be jumping around both that and freeCodeCamp. Today, I completed the Welcome to Coding section, and got about halfway through the Intro to Programming one.
-   **Challenges you faced:** None really. This is all review so far, the biggest challenge was that I'm going through the lessons while working, so I had to keep pausing to take calls lol.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the Intro to Programming section

## Day 2 - 07/27/21

-   **Project you are working on:** The Intro to Programming section on appacademy
-   **Progress today:** Got most of it done between calls at work tonight. It's all just reviewing very basic concepts that I've already 'reviewed' so many times at this point. It's embarrassing how many times I stop trying to learn for a period of time, then come back to it and feel like I have to start all over, then make it through all the basics and then something comes up so I stop putting time into programming again. It almost feels like cheating to count these first days lol. But, it's time that I'm dedicating to it each day. Even if it isn't particularly challenging.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Uh, WTF is up with Ruby? Lol so I know all the concepts already, but I learned them in JS. So I'm like *ok, method. That's a function. But wait... where are your brackets? def..end? That's weird. I don't like that.* 'Challenges' today were just trying to unlearn the JS I know. Not the concepts, just the little things, where it looks a bit different in a different programming language. Even if it is weird. (How can you call a function without the parenthesis? If it doesn't take any arguments, fine I guess. Still feels... idk, incomplete. But like. greet "John" instead of greet("John") ?? One of those just doesn't feel right lol)
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the Intro to Programming section

## Day 3 - 07/28/21

-   **Project you are working on:** Intro to Programming on appacademy
-   **Progress today:** The sections on Conditionals, Loops, and most of the one on Arrays, I just have a few more of the exercises for that one to do. I've underestimated the challenges here, lol. I'm not expecting to finish the entire Intro to Programming part in a day anymore. Maybe a section and a half is a more practical estimate.
-   **Challenges you faced:** I keep trying to write in javascript I think. I'm forgetting to add 'end' in the right places, and also keep doing 'else if' instead of 'elsif'. Little things like that, but I'm starting to get the hang of it.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the arrays exercises, then complete the lectures and exercises on Enumerables and Ranges.

## Day 4 - 07/29/21

-   **Project you are working on:** Intro to Programming on appacademy
-   **Progress today:** Finished the arrays exercises, and the Enumerables and Ranges lectures section.
-   **Challenges you faced:** --
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the exercises, and then get through the at least the lectures on the Nested Loops and 2D Arrays section.

## Day 5 - 7/30/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Intro to Programming on appacademy
-   **Progress today:** Got through a few of the challenges, but I'm going to need to rewatch a few of the lectures tomorrow.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Some of the challenges have me stumped, but I think it's because I'm overcomplicating things.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** I'm too tired to rewatch anything tonight. I'm going to go over the lectures for this section again, and then tackle the rest of the challenges tomorrow.

## Day 6 - 7/31/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** No real project, just kind of jumping around with things.
-   **Progress today:** Did a lot of reading about APIs (still don't quite understand) and played around with the start of some of the other courses on freeCodeCamp. I followed along the appacademy video tutorials about installing ubuntu and ruby. Shortly before deciding I didn't want to focus on learning Ruby right now. ope.
-   **Challenges you faced:** APIs dont quite make sense to me. I mean they do, just not how to implement them like within code. But I was really all over the place with what I was reading about so it's not really discouraging that I was confused. I just haven't gotten there yet. I also struggled with ubuntu because the tutorial was for a different version of it I guess. I figured out what the issue was there, but again it doesn't really matter since I'm not using appacademy I don't think. For now, at least.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Pick a dang project, April.
